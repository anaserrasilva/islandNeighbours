\title{xRFneighbourhoods Function}
\usage{
xRFneighbourhoods(tree, verbose = TRUE, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{an object of class "multiPhylo"}

\item{verbose}{Prints the function's progress. Defaults to TRUE. If run in parallel set to FALSE.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value setting the x-RF island threshold}
}
\value{
List of "multiPhylo" objects
}
\description{
This function extracts the x-RF neighbourhoods from a multiPhylo object, it generates a list of multiPhylo objects containing all trees shared between each tree's x-RF neighbourhood and the multiPhylo object.
At this time the package might not accurately place unresolved trees into islands.
}
\examples{
data(testTrees)
neighbourhoods <- xRFneighbourhoods(testTrees, threshold = 2)
islands <- neighbourhoodMerger(neighbourhoods)
#write.islands(islands)
